# UnSupervisedLearning_AutoEncoders
Created a autoencoders neural net which performs encoding and decoding to get prediction of movie ratings based on the input

So, I have make this AutoEncoders neural network to make predictions . I am taking this course on Udemy called Deep Learning A-Z.

From this program, you'll be able to understand how to build an StackedAutoencoders from scratch with data preprocessing and building neural network. Don't forget to download all necessary libraries like PyTorch, Keras and Numpy. Enjoy Deep Learning! #GoogleColab
